The gouraud shader assignment from CPSC-486

Description: The purpose of this project is to make sure the student understands the differences between a gouraud shader and a blinn-phong shader. The assignment provides the student with an already made program that already contains a blinn-phong shader.
The project uses glsl 1.20 which means that the use of in and out variables still did not exist and were instead called varying variables, which served much the same purpose, only being slightly missnamed in my opinion.
